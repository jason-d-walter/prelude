(defun insert-random-uuid ()
  "Insert a UUID.  This perform a simple hashing of variable data.
Example of a UUID: 1df63142-a513-c850-31a3-535fc3520c3d

Note: this code uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5 , which is
not cryptographically safe.  I'm not sure what's the implication
of its use here."
